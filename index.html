          <p class="text-xl py-4 font-bold text-gray-900">Case of the 2010 Philippine Senate Plagiarism Scandal</p>
        </div>
        <p>In 2010, a Philippine senator was accused of plagiarizing a substantial portion of a speech delivered by a U.S. senator, with the plagiarized sections pointed out publicly in the media. The senator did not face any criminal charges, but the scandal led to significant public embarrassment and political consequences, damaging the senator’s reputation and credibility. No formal academic or criminal penalties were applied, as the case was considered an ethical violation rather than a copyright infringement. Under the Intellectual Property Code, plagiarism involving the copying of copyrighted materials, such as speeches, could lead to civil penalties, including damages and injunctive relief, but no legal action was taken in this case.</p>

          <p class="text-xl py-4 font-bold text-gray-900">Case of Professor Xiao (2017) – Plagiarism in Research</p>
        </div>
        <p>In 2017, a professor from a prominent Philippine university was accused of plagiarizing parts of a published research paper by using sections from foreign researchers' work without proper attribution, a case brought to light by a student involved in reviewing the research. The university imposed internal disciplinary actions, including reprimands and removal from research projects, and the plagiarized articles were retracted, though no criminal charges were filed. The incident significantly damaged the professor’s professional and academic reputation. Under the Intellectual Property Code (RA 8293), plagiarism involving copyrighted materials could lead to civil penalties such as payment of damages, injunctions, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment (1-3 years) and fines (₱50,000 to ₱200,000), though these were not applied in this case.</p>

          <p class="text-xl py-4 font-bold text-gray-900">The Case of a Popular Filipino Blogger (2015)</p>
        </div>
        <p> Well-known Filipino blogger was accused of plagiarizing content from various international websites by copying articles and presenting them as their own without attribution or permission. The incident led to public backlash, with followers demanding an apology, and the plagiarized blog post was taken down, causing significant damage to the blogger's reputation and brand, though no legal punishment was pursued. Under the Intellectual Property Code (RA 8293), if the copied content had been copyrighted, the original authors could have filed a copyright infringement suit, potentially resulting in damages, injunctions to stop further publication, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment and fines, but these measures were not applied in this case.</p>
